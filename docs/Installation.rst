Installation and Usage
=========================================

1. Install the finufft_ library, including all of its required libraries
2. Download contents of sinctransform package, i.e. "git clone https://github.com/hannahlawrence/sinctransform.git"

.. _finufft: https://github.com/ahbarnett/finufft

Configuration
---------------

1. In the makefile, change FINUFFT to the path to finufft: 

.. code::
	
	FINUFFT = /some/path/to/finufft

1. In the makefile, change FFTW to the directory containing the fftw library: 

.. code::

	FFTW = /some/path/to/fft 

(Note: on a Mac, this may be /usr/local/lib. On linux it is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu)

Testing
-------

Run `make all` to build and test the library. All tests and examples should
complete without error. The tests should run for less than 30 seconds.


Usage
----------------

To use in other programs, begin by creating the static library:

.. code::

	make lib

This creates `libsinc.a`, which should be linked against your code.
In your code, make sure to include the header file:

.. code::

	#include "sinctransform.hpp"

The sinc functions also expect a complex<double> array for q (even if all the complex values are 0), so it will also be necessary to include the corresponding header:

.. code::
	
	#include <complex>
	
Then compile with both the sinctransform and finufft static libraries, e.g.

.. code::

	g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -g -o myprog myprog.cpp /path/to/libsinc.a /path/to/finufft/lib/libfinufft.a -lfftw3 -lm

It may be necessary to include a flag telling the compiler where to find the FFTW library, which is a prerequisite for the finufft library. To do so, add the flag "-L/some/dir" such that /some/dir contains the static FFTW library (.a file, in lib-static directory of finufft library).
