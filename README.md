## Documentation
Please see the primary documentation [here](http://fast-sinc-transform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions, example code, derivations, licenses, etc. 

## Prerequisites
Note that this code crucially requires the [FINUFFT](https://github.com/ahbarnett/finufft) library, as detailed in the installation instructions, as well as all of its required libraries (FFTW, for example).
